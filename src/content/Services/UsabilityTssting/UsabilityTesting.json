We evaluate user experience when interacting with a Website or Mobile application for better user experience and expose your product to real people. This identifies problems that you may have missed asking real users rather than the resources of developers or testers. The results, success rate, and outlay taken to complete the tasks are then analyzed to identify the extensive issues and areas of improvement. We aim to create a product with a positive experience that meets customer objectives."

      "description": "To test entirely at different locations we use remote usability test with the help of tools or software that allows users to share the screen and record their responses. At a physical location, we perform an In-person usability test usually at a usability lab or any other research space. This is mostly used for products that require safety considerations, Supervision during use or physical testing. So far we are experts in Remote testing maximizing user research minimizing cost-effective solutions and allocating dedicated teams to record the responses and actions in order to provide custom solutions as per the customer's satisfaction and needs."
